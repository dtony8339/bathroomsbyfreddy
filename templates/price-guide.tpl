                    <p>This quote will be filled by our longest-experienced tradespeople. They’ve been on the job for over 10 years. It will also cover top quality materials should you desire them, which naturally cost more.</p>
                    
                    
                	<h2 class="grade-title">B. Grade</h2>
                    <p>These are tradespeople of intermediate experience - from 3 to 10 years on the job. Materials can also be intermediate - it all depends on your budget. B Grade is not the cheapest or the most expensive. However, you pay a little extra for quality.</p>
                    
                    
                    
                	<h2 class="grade-title">C. Grade</h2>
                    <p>If anyone quotes you cheaper than our A or B, we can better that quote with our C Grade. You can expect a lower price because these younger tradespeople want to gain more experience. They have been on the job for 3+ yrs.</p>
